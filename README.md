This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error stemming from the language's dynamic typing. The `bug.js` file contains a function that unintentionally concatenates a string and a number due to loose type checking. The `bugSolution.js` file shows how to solve this issue using explicit type checking or type coercion.
